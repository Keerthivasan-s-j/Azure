Virtualization
---------------
	virtualization is a technology that can be used to represent a servers and other physical machines works on the os splits the resources between the operations like installing 2 os in the same machine which shares the same ram cloud is the resource accessed from the service provide it does not require service from the local machine


types of hyper wiser
---------------------

type 1:
---------
 - oracle
 - Microsoft hyper V
 - itrix

type 2:
-------
 - VMware
 - workstation
 - VMware fusion
 - oracle virtual box

Application virtualization:
---------------------------
 - network
 - desktop
 - storage
 - application
 - server

cloud computing:
----------------
	using on demand services using internet with the help of cloud service providers like AWS

how IT works?
-------------
	capital expenditure - capex => mudhaledu like pre paid sim
	the service provider like godady, zoho and so on
	opex - operational expenditure - billing for the things that we used like post paid sims this is used in cloud computing

AWS first cloud service provider
Azure
google cloud

Cloud models
-------------
	private - only we can able to access the service
	public - everyone can able to access the service
	hybrid - combination of public and private 

Azure
-----
	Azure is a computing platform and online portal that allows you to access and manage cloud services and resources launched on Feb 1 2010
free to start and need to switch to the pay as go model

Datacenter 
-----------
	it is physical building that contains the severs like data server, network sever ...
	colling system
	uninterrupted internet and power
	PDU
	data Engineering and network Engineering will be there to fix the issues in the DC

available zone
--------------
	Available zone is a unique physical location within Azure region

	it is used to reduce the up time

	it act as proxy servers which act as a inter mediate between the cloud service provider and the end user when a user request for a data from the cloud if the cloud it not reachable the data is fetched from the backup server it is called as available zone

Example
-------
	if DC 1 is busy the data is fetched from the nearby DC 2

azure vm
bind resource group or create one
identification for the virtual machine
the resource and the resource region must be the same
choose the iso image

load balancer types
-------------------
	* internal
	* external

creating load balancer
----------------------
create a virtual machine for ubuntu
open the ubuntu terminal 
past the code 
open load balancer and create one based on the instruction given in the pdf

IOT hub
-------


data bricks
-----------
it is a Apache based analytics platform
data science engineer's analyst 
	1.apache spark
		-> note book
			we can able to process with our preferred language
			switching programming language is easy
			it has multiple cells
		-> big data
			process data
			transfer the data 
	2.ETL - Extra Transform Load
		source to destination transfer
		Apache spark is used to perform this transform
	3.machine learning
		training models
	4.SQL Editor
	5.Collaborations
